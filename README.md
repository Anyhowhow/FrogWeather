# FrogWeather
FrogWeather is an Android APP designed by Wanglihao, Yangzeliang and Wangchujie from Sichuan University.
It can help get temperature,humidity and pressure around you by sensors in your device if your device have such sensors.We tested it by Samsung Galaxy Note3,and it can work well.
Besides,you can get your location by AMAP Map and weather information by China Meteorological Administration through Internet.
It's our first Android APP,so it's very simple.Hope to make it better in the future.
Addicted to learning, wasting away.
